# Weather-Display

I created a weather tracking website using a weather api. The user inputs a city and and the page will display the current weather and the 5 day forecast. The current weather and 5 day forecast will display the days' temperature, wind speed, and humidity. The page also features a city search history that allows the user to easily search the weather for previously searched cities. 

The CSS and HTML is styled after a reference image and the JS code was written from scratch. 

The finished site can be found [Here](https://elliottli97.github.io/Weather-Display/)
